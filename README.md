garrett's great hrtf (& sofa) functions

![happyday](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bebd27f1-a986-41f4-ac94-de0751135a18)

the best (and only) dedicated tool for analyzing both hrtf files and sofa files, while also containing the ability to convolve them and export the convolutions! does it ever get better than this?

as a note, i have only tested (and will only support) windows 11. windows 10 *should* work, since the run-time .dlls from visual studio 2015 are included in windows 10 onward, but i have not tested this. if you intend on running this on an older version of windows (vista to 8.1), ensure that you have the run-time
.dlls for visual studio 2015 (more info here: [universal crt](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/introducing-the-universal-crt)). you should be able to get this from downloading the [windows 10 sdk](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/).
